# 💻 HTML & CSS Practice Projects

Welcome to my collection of HTML & CSS practice projects.  
These mini projects were created as part of my front-end learning journey to improve my HTML/CSS layout, structure, and styling skills.  
Each project focuses on different concepts — from landing pages to portfolios and gallery layouts.
